Let's look at three examples that illustrate the AI prompt elements of instruction, input, context, and output.

### Example 1: Generating a Short Story

**Instruction**:
"Write a short story about a cat who becomes a hero."

**Input**:
No specific input provided, relying on the AI's internal knowledge.

**Context**:
"The story should be suitable for children and should have a positive moral lesson."

**Output**:
"Once in a small village, there lived a clever cat named Whiskers. One day, a fire broke out in the village, and everyone was in a panic. Whiskers noticed a baby trapped in a house and bravely dashed inside, meowing loudly to guide the villagers. Thanks to Whiskers' bravery, the baby was saved, and the village honored Whiskers as a hero. The villagers learned the importance of quick thinking and courage in the face of danger."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: Directs the AI to write a story about a cat hero.
- **Input**: No additional input is needed beyond the instruction.
- **Context**: Specifies the story's audience (children) and the desired moral tone.
- **Output**: The AI generates a short, child-friendly story with a positive moral.

### Example 2: Creating a Summary

**Instruction**:
"Summarize the following article in one paragraph."

**Input**:
"[Insert article text about climate change impacts here]"

**Context**:
"The summary should highlight the key points and be understandable to a general audience."

**Output**:
"The article discusses the significant impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. It highlights the urgent need for global cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changes already in progress. The article also emphasizes the role of technological innovation and sustainable practices in mitigating these effects."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: Directs the AI to create a summary.
- **Input**: The article text on climate change.
- **Context**: Instructs the AI to make the summary accessible and focus on key points.
- **Output**: A concise, clear summary of the article's main points.

### Example 3: Writing a Technical Explanation

**Instruction**:
"Explain how a solar panel works."

**Input**:
No specific input provided, relying on the AI's internal knowledge.

**Context**:
"The explanation should be detailed enough for a high school science student to understand."

**Output**:
"A solar panel works by converting sunlight into electricity. It is made up of many solar cells, which are composed of semiconductor materials like silicon. When sunlight hits these cells, it excites electrons, creating an electric current. This process, known as the photovoltaic effect, generates direct current (DC) electricity, which can be converted to alternating current (AC) by an inverter for use in homes and businesses. Solar panels are an essential component of renewable energy systems, providing a clean and sustainable source of power."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: Directs the AI to explain how a solar panel works.
- **Input**: No specific external input needed.
- **Context**: Specifies the target audience (high school science students) and the desired level of detail.
- **Output**: A detailed yet accessible explanation of solar panel operation.

These examples demonstrate how the instruction, input,
