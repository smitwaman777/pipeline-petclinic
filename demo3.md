## Designing and Explaining Prompts for Different Tasks

In the following examples, we'll cover various tasks using different prompts.

### 1. Text Summarization

**Prompt**:
"In the next slide, summarize the provided article about climate change in 3-4 sentences."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Summarize"
- **Input**: "provided article about climate change"
- **Context**: "in 3-4 sentences"
- **Output**: A concise summary.

**Example**:
- **Article**: [Insert article text here]
- **Summary**: "Climate change poses significant challenges globally. Rising temperatures lead to melting ice caps and sea-level rise, threatening coastal communities. Addressing climate change requires urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources."

### 2. Question Answering

**Prompt**:
"On the next slide, answer the question: What are the effects of deforestation on the environment?"

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Answer"
- **Input**: "question: What are the effects of deforestation on the environment?"
- **Context**: None needed.
- **Output**: A clear response.

**Example**:
- **Question**: "What are the effects of deforestation on the environment?"
- **Answer**: "Deforestation leads to habitat loss, soil erosion, and disruption of the water cycle. It also contributes to climate change by reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide."

### 3. Text Classification

**Prompt**:
"Classify the provided review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral in the next slide."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Classify"
- **Input**: "provided review"
- **Context**: "Positive, Negative, or Neutral"
- **Output**: A classification label.

**Example**:
- **Review**: "The product exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it."
- **Classification**: "Positive"

### 4. Role Playing

**Prompt**:
"In the next slide, assume the role of a customer service representative and respond to the following complaint: 'I received a damaged item.'"

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Respond"
- **Input**: "complaint: 'I received a damaged item.'"
- **Context**: None needed.
- **Output**: A customer service response.

**Example**:
- **Complaint**: "I received a damaged item."
- **Response**: "I apologize for the inconvenience. Please provide your order number, and we'll arrange for a replacement to be sent to you right away."

### 5. Code Generation

**Prompt**:
"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number in the next slide."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Write"
- **Input**: "Python function to calculate the factorial"
- **Context**: None needed.
- **Output**: Python code.

**Example**:
- **Function**: "Calculate the factorial of a given number."
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 0:
          return 1
      else:
          return n * factorial(n-1)
  ```

### 6. Reasoning

**Prompt**:
"On the next slide, explain why renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change."

**Explanation**:
- **Instruction**: "Explain"
- **Input**: "why renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change"
- **Context**: None needed.
- **Output**: A reasoned explanation.

**Example**:
- **Topic**: "Renewable energy and climate change"
- **Explanation**: "Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels. Transitioning to renewable energy reduces reliance on finite resources and mitigates the effects of climate change by decreasing carbon emissions."

These prompts guide AI models to perform specific tasks effectively by providing clear instructions, inputs, and expected outputs.
